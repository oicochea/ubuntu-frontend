### User Stories 
- User can create a new project that once submitted will make a Post request 
- User can utilize the update button next to each created project that will take them to a form that makes a Put request
- User can utilize the delete button next to each project that will send a delete request 

### Technologies Used 
- React
- Node.js
- Milligram
- Flexbox

### Approach Taken
- Tech lead = Leanne
- wireframe 
    - Sketch
- frontend created by Lydia and Leanne

### Unsolved Problems
- search for events by zipcode 


### Improvements for Later
- search local projects from home page without logging in
- have user name show when logged in
- have events auto remove when date of event has passed
